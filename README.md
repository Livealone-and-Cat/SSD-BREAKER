# SSD-BREAKER
## 很不幸，我的笔记本电脑被父母收了。
 *Unfortunately, my laptop was confiscated by my parents.*
## 所以我要破坏他们的电脑以夺回我的电脑。
## *So I'm going to destroy their computers to get mine back.*
## 嘘！别被他们听见了。这个程序献给与我有相同经历的人，祝你们早日恢复自由！
 *Shh! Don't let them hear it. This program is dedicated to those who have the same experience as me. I hope you can regain your freedom soon!*
## 拜托了，我拿电脑又不是天天打游戏，我只是运行AI模型和使用Photoshop罢了，为什么不让我能拿到自己的电脑呢，我的数据全部都没办法访问啊！该死的。
 *Please, I don't use the computer to play games every day, I just run AI models and use Photoshop, why can't I get my own computer? I can't access any of my data! Damn it.*
